# actions/todo-to-issue:jeff
#
# This is an experimental (for me) TODO.md -> Github Issue 
# action that will trigger upon (at minimum), every commit 
# push made to this repository.
#
# actions/checkout@v5 introduces additional features.
# In particular, this action will attempt to sync all 
# changes made, such as task completion, etc end to 
# end. A GitHub issue reference will be added below 
# each task entry (TODO.md). Other "surprises" are surely in 
# store for us.
# 
# SEE ALSO:
# 1. https://github.com/marketplace/actions/todo-to-issue
#
# IMPORTANT(JEFF): Note that if you set multiple triggers -- 
# i.e. both pull_request and push -- this can result in 
# duplicate issues.
